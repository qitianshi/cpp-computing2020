# Contributing
You're welcome to contribute to this project!

To contribute directly, create a [branch](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-branches), make your edits, create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests), and in time it'll be merged. Remember to follow the usual best practices in coding:
* __Make sure your code is readable and understandable.__ Use proper indentation, blocks, spacing, and naming conventions.
* __Add comments and documentation so others can follow along.__ Describe what your code is doing (but only where it isn't already obvious); document functions, structures, classes, and other components of your code; and explain each step of your algorithms. Use proper grammar and spelling.
* __Check that your code follows the best possible logic.__ Don't repeat yourself, never hard-code or brute-force, avoid deep nesting, and make sure your code follows a logical sequence of actions.
* __Write clear commit messages.__ Describe major changes, or issues you're attempting to resolve. Remember to [reference commit or issue numbers](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/autolinked-references-and-urls) if you need to.

Or, you can submit an issue on GitHub to discuss tasks, enhancements, and bugs. [See how.](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)
