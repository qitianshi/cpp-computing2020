# Longest increasing subsequence
Find the longest increasing subsequence in a sequence of numbers.

## Description
Given a sequence of numbers, `S`, find the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

The subsequence does not need to be contiguous.

## Constraints
`Sᵢ ∈ ℤ`

## Input
*From `data.txt`:*
* `line 1`: the sequence, `S`.

## Output
*To the console:*
* The length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.
* The numbers in any of the longest strictly increasing subsequences, separated by spaces.
