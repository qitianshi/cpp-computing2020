# C++ lesson files
Lesson files from the C++ Computing module.

## Introduction
This repository is an archive of questions, solutions, demo code, and other lesson files used in the C++ module of Hwa Chong Institution's Sec 4 Computing course.

Use it as a reference or to improve your own work! Or, even better, you can [contribute to this project](#contributing) too.

## Getting started
This isn't prepackaged software, it's a collection of individual files; there aren't any installers or packages. Download or copy files or snippets and run it in your own projects.

Assignment folders typically include a problem description, a data file, and source code â€” you'll need all three to run it. Remember to set up your IDE or compiler to read from file by choosing the right working directory. Check the specific instructions for your editor.
