# C++ lesson files
Questions, solutions, demo code, and other lesson files from the C++ Computing module.

## Introduction
This repository is an archive of questions, solutions, demo code, and other lesson files used in the C++ module of Hwa Chong's Sec 4 Computing course.

Use it as a reference or to improve your own work! Or, even better, you can [contribute to this project](#contributing) too.

## Getting started
This isn't prepackaged software; it's a collection of individual lesson files. There aren't any installers or packages. Download or copy files or snippets and run it in your own projects.

Each assignment folder comes with a problem description, a data file, and source code â€” you'll need all three to run it. Remember to set up your IDE or compiler to read from files by choosing a custom working directory. Check the specific steps for your own editor.

## Contributing
You're welcome to contribute to this project!

To contribute directly, create a [branch](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-branches), make your edits, create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests), and in time it'll be merged. Remember to follow the usual best practices in coding:
* __Make sure your code is readable and understandable.__ Use proper indentation, blocks, spacing, and naming conventions.
* __Add comments and documentation so others can follow along.__ Describe what your code is doing (but only where it isn't already obvious); document functions, structures, classes, and other components of your code; and explain each step of your algorithms. Use proper grammar and spelling.
* __Check that your code follows the best possible logic.__ Don't repeat yourself, never hard-code or brute-force, avoid deep nesting, and make sure your code follows a logical sequence of actions.
* __Follow the conventions for branches, pull requests and commits.__ Be descriptive and concise; don't create vaguely-worded commit messages, [branch names](https://gist.github.com/digitaljhelms/4287848), or pull requests. Remember to [reference commit, issue, or pull request numbers](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/autolinked-references-and-urls) if you need to.

Or, you can submit an issue on GitHub to discuss tasks, enhancements, and bugs. [See how.](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)
