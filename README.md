# C++ lesson files
Questions, solutions, demo code, and other lesson files from the C++ Computing module.

## Introduction
This repository is an archive of questions, solutions, demo code, and other lesson files used in the C++ module of Hwa Chong's Sec 4 Computing course.

Use it as a reference or to improve your own work! Or, even better, you can [contribute to this project](#contributing) too.

## Getting started
This isn't prepackaged software; it's a collection of individual lesson files. There aren't any installers or packages. Download or copy files or snippets and run it in your own projects.

Each assignment folder comes with a problem description, a data file, and source code â€” you'll need all three to run it. Remember to set up your IDE or compiler to read from files by choosing a custom working directory. Check the specific steps for your own editor.

## Contributing
Anyone can contribute! You can create pull requests or open issues on GitHub.

[See the guidelines.](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Technologies
This project was built with C++17.

## Status
This project is still being maintained at the moment. More lesson files will be added as they become available, and existing code will continue to be updated.
