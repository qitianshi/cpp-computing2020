# Road network

## Description
Given `N` cities, numbered `0` to `N-1`, on a road network, find the cities that are not reachable from each city.

## Input (`data.txt`)
The first line will be an integer `N`, `(0 < N â‰¤ 100)`, the number of cities.

The second line will be an integer `M`, the number of routes.

Each of the following `M` lines will consist of two integers `a` and `b`, representing a one way route from city `a` to city `b`.

## Output (console)
A list of cities that are not reachable from each city.
